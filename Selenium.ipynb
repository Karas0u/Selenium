       "['CAIRO (AP) — The European Union on Sunday announced a $8 billion aid package for cash-strapped Egypt amid concerns that economic pressure and conflicts and chaos in neighboring countries could drive more migrants to European shores.\\nThe deal is scheduled to be signed during a visit by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the leaders of Belgium, Italy, Austria, Cyprus and Greece, according to Egyptian officials.\\nThe package includes both grants and loans over the next three years for the Arab world’s most populous country, according to the European Union Mission in Cairo.\\nThe EU will provide assistance to Egypt’s government to fortify its borders especially with Libya, a major transit point for migrants fleeing poverty and conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, and will support the government in hosting Sudanese who have fled nearly a year of fighting between rival generals in their country.\\nEgypt has for decades been a refuge for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa trying to escape war or poverty. For some, Egypt is a destination and a haven, the closest and easiest country for them to reach. For others, it is a point of transit before attempting the dangerous Mediterranean crossing to Europe.',\n",
       " 'By Nidal al-Mughrabi\\nCAIRO, March 17 (Reuters) - Trucks of flour have reached northern Gaza for distribution to areas that have had no aid in four months, Palestinian media reported on Sunday, with famine looming in the enclave and truce talks between Israel and Hamas due to resume in Qatar.\\nA convoy of 12 trucks arrived in the north on Saturday - six in Gaza City and six in the Jabalia refugee camp - carrying supplies to also be distributed to the northernmost areas of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, the media and residents said.\\nThe Hamas-linked Home Front media outlet reported that the aid was distributed by the \"Popular Committees\", a group that includes leaders of powerful clans in Gaza. A Hamas source said the route was secured by Hamas security personnel.\\nAid agencies have warned that pockets of Gaza already face famine, with hospitals in the north reporting children dying of malnutrition and dehydration.\\nThe hunger crisis has piled international pressure on Israel more than five months into its ground and air campaign in Gaza, triggered by the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, with more talks for a ceasefire and hostage exchange expected in the coming days.\\nHamas killed around 1,200 people in its attack and seized 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel\\'s military campaign in Gaza has now killed more than 31,500 Palestinians according to health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza.\\nAn Israeli strike overnight killed 12 people in one house in Deir al-Balah in the centre of the tiny, crowded Gaza Strip, the health ministry said, among 92 people it said had been killed in the previous 24 hours.\\nIsrael\\'s stated war aim is to wipe out Hamas, and it has said this can only be achieved with an assault on Rafah on the border with Egypt, the last relatively safe place for civilians who have flocked to camps there from other parts of Gaza.\\nIsrael\\'s Western allies have warned it against attacking Rafah, however, unless it is able to protect civilians. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s office said on Friday he had approved plans for an assault.\\nStory continues',\n",

The appeal for investors on the other side of such deals is that they get double-digit returns, while banks get capital relief, freeing them up to do more business.\\nNewmarket, a Philadelphia-based alternative asset manager that specializes in structured credit, is now pitching a similar mechanism for banks to repackage and transfer their so-called financed emissions, which represent the greenhouse gas pollution linked to their lending and investment activities. Banks that channel a lot of capital into the fossil fuel industry, for example, would have big financed emissions.\\nThe idea is to “transfer the credit risk, but at the same time transfer the so-called emissions risk to a third-party investor outside of the banking system, such as ourselves,” Hohns said.\\nSuch structured products would be the latest in a string of innovations that includes everything from debt-for-nature swaps to novel use of carbon offsets, as the wizards of high finance experiment with new instruments to tackle climate risk. Applying a risk-transfer model to carbon emissions remains experimental, in large part because it’s hard to assign monetary values to such risk and because no rules exist to guide such a construction.\\nStory continues',\n",

He casts it as a \"special military operation\".\\nWar has hung over the three day election: Ukraine has repeatedly attacked oil refineries in Russia, shelled Russian regions and sought to pierce Russian borders with proxy forces - a move Putin said would not be left unpunished.\\nWhile Putin\\'s re-election is not in doubt given his control over Russia and the absence of any real challengers, the former KGB spy wants to show that he has the overwhelming support of Russians. Voting ends at 1800 GMT on Sunday.\\nThe Kremlin has sought a high turnout, and as polls opened for a third day in western Russia, officials said the turnout in the first two days had already reached 63% nationwide. An exit poll will be published shortly after voting ends at 1800 GMT.\\nSupporters of Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month, had called on Russians to come out at a \"Noon against Putin\" protest to show their dissent against a leader they cast as a corrupt autocrat.\\n\"Alexei was fighting for very simple things: for freedom of speech, for fair elections, for democracy and our right to live without corruption and war,\" Navalny\\'s widow, Yulia, said in a message to a rally in Budapest on March 15.\\nStory continues',\n",
       " '(Bloomberg) -- On the outskirts of Rotterdam, a bright orange ship is hoisted above the muddy Rhine with the help of six chunky triangular legs. The vessel has just been retrofit with a huge crane capable of lifting up to 1,600 tons 160 meters above deck. Once the finishing touches have been made, the Wind Osprey will take off for Germany, and return to building wind turbines at sea.\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\nApple Without AI Looks More Like Coca-Cola Than High-Growth Tech\\nUS Probing Indian Billionaire Gautam Adani and His Group Over Potential Bribery\\nWhat Does the UAE Get for Its $35 Billion Investment in Egypt?\\nWant to Be ‘Certified Crypto Expert?’ You Need 11 Hours and $229\\nTwo Airplanes Lugging Cargo Together Is Texas Startup’s Big Bet\\nAs governments green their economies and utilities retire fossil-fuel power stations, wind installations are emerging as one of the most popular forms of alternative energy. Globally, offshore wind capacity is poised to quintuple between 2022 and the middle of the next decade, according to BloombergNEF, and to squeeze more energy out of the wind, turbines are getting bigger and bigger. That means that ships capable of installing them are in growing demand.\\nAnd at the moment, the fleet isn’t expanding quickly enough.\\nClarksons Offshore Renewables, a shipping broker that matches vessels with project developers, estimates that there are between 15 and 20 ships outside China able to install turbines with a minimum 15-megawatt capacity, and that more will be needed in the next several years. Consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. says that there are about 40 ships operating outside China, though not all are used exclusively for offshore wind. To meet future demand, Woodmac anticipates about $14.8 billion will need to be invested. So far, only about a third of that has actually been committed.\\nBuilding an enormous wind turbine is a complicated task on land, never mind on the open ocean. It starts with carefully loading components onto a ship. Towers and blades can be more than 100 meters long, and the container that houses the generator, called a nacelle, is around the size of a villa. Once the ship reaches the future site of the turbine, the pieces must be removed and assembled. It takes roughly three days to install just one turbine, depending on travel time to port.\\nStory continues',\n",

       " '(Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak’s government is facing the same levels of economic misery that led to the Conservative Party’s defeat in 1997, helping explain why the prime minister plans to delay the next election until late this year.\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\nApple Without AI Looks More Like Coca-Cola Than High-Growth Tech\\nUS Probing Indian Billionaire Gautam Adani and His Group Over Potential Bribery\\nWhat Does the UAE Get for Its $35 Billion Investment in Egypt?\\nWant to Be ‘Certified Crypto Expert?’ You Need 11 Hours and $229\\nTwo Airplanes Lugging Cargo Together Is Texas Startup’s Big Bet\\nThe Misery Index, created in the 1970s to capture the combined impacts of unemployment and inflation, is likely to improve over the next 12 months in the UK as price pressures dissipate. For now, and during Liz Truss’s brief term as premier in 2022, it’s showing its worst levels since John Major was ejected from office.\\nThe figures shed light on how voters feel about an economy that tipped into recession in 2023 and is still struggling with a cost-of-living crisis. Sunak must call an election by January 2025 and has said his assumption is he’ll call a poll in the autumn, giving time for the most painful impacts to recede.\\n“From an economic perspective, it makes sense for Sunak to wait as long as he can before calling an election,” said Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in London. “Later in the year the economy will probably be out of recession, a recovery will most likely be underway, inflation will be lower, households’ real wages will be rising and interest rates will probably be falling.”\\nThe misery index, based on a Bloomberg analysis of unemployment and inflation data from the Office for National Statistics, averaged almost 12 since Sunak took office in October 2022. That’s down from 15 under Truss, the most painful period since the 1990s, but up from the levels under every administration from Tony Blair through Boris Johnson.\\nStory continues',\n",
